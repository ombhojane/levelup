# Jurisdictional Risk Factors for Cross-Border Transactions

## High-Risk Jurisdictions

### FATF High-Risk Jurisdictions Subject to Countermeasures
Countries identified by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as having significant strategic deficiencies in their regimes to counter money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing:

#### Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
FATF remains concerned by DPRK's failure to address significant AML/CFT deficiencies. Financial institutions should:
- Terminate correspondent relationships with DPRK banks
- Close any subsidiaries or branches of DPRK banks
- Limit business relationships and financial transactions with DPRK persons

Additional risk factors:
- Frequent use of front companies, shell companies, and joint ventures to violate sanctions
- Enhanced due diligence required due to increased financial connectivity

#### Iran
- Action plan expired January 2018 and remains incomplete
- FATF has fully lifted suspension of countermeasures
- Will remain high-risk until full Action Plan completion
- Key deficiencies:
  - Inadequate criminalization of terrorist financing
  - Insufficient identification/freezing of terrorist assets
  - Insufficient customer due diligence regime
  - Inadequate identification of unlicensed money/value transfer services
  - Failure to implement Palermo and Terrorist Financing Conventions

#### Myanmar (Subject to Enhanced Due Diligence)
- Action plan expired September 2021
- Enhanced due diligence measures required proportionate to risk
- Countermeasures possible if no progress by June 2025
- Recent progress on targeted financial sanctions for proliferation financing
- Remaining deficiencies:
  - Limited use of financial intelligence in investigations
  - Insufficient money laundering investigation/prosecution
  - Inadequate investigation of transnational cases
  - Insufficient freezing/seizing of criminal proceeds
